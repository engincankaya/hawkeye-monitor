# Hawkeye Monitor

Hawkeye Monitor is a Python-based system monitoring tool that allows you to track and analyze various system resources and performance metrics in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of system resources:
  - CPU usage
  - RAM usage
  - Disk usage
  - Network traffic
  - CPU temperature (Linux only)
  - Power consumption (Windows only)
  
- Data analysis capabilities.

## Usage

To start monitoring your system, run the following command:
